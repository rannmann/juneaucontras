  "content": "## About Contra Dancing\n\nContra dancing is a form of American folk dance in which couples dance in long lines. It's easy to learn - a caller teaches all the moves and calls them out during the dance. You don't need to bring a partner; it's traditional to dance with many different people throughout the evening.\n\n## What to Expect\n\n- **Beginners welcome!** We often have a newcomers' lesson 15 minutes before the dance starts\n- **All dances are taught** - the caller will walk through each dance before the music starts\n- **Live music** from talented local and visiting musicians\n- **Friendly community** - we're known for being welcoming to newcomers\n- **All ages welcome** - we've had dancers from 8 to 80!\n\n## What to Bring\n\n- **Comfortable clothes** you can move in\n- **Smooth-soled shoes** (avoid rubber soles that grip the floor)\n- **Water bottle** - dancing is exercise!\n- **A smile** and willingness to have fun",
